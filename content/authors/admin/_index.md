I was born on March 22, 1997 at Surabaya. I am a Research & Development staff at PT Mohairson Pawan Khatulistiwa which concentrated in climate study. I am working on analysis and forecast the climate datasets which can gain from climate model or observation. As assistant lecturer, I teach the technical analysis how to use computer software (R, NCL, and Python), specific for climate data processing.
